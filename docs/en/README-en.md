# [pyShannon](https://github.com/Ximenzhengmo/pyShannon) -- an information theory Lib

## Intro

This is a Lib for the simulation and calculation of Information Theory. The owner write this lib during studying the course...

### Capacity (to be continued)

There is some usage example in `example.py`

* Calculate any entropy and any mutual information between any discrete distributions.
  * I(x), I(X), H(X), H(XY), H(X|Y), I(x;y), I(X;y), I(X,Y) ... 
* Calculate the joint probability distribution of Markov chains of any order and any length/dims
  * Markov Chain $X_1X_2X_3...X_n$ -> $P(X_k),P(X_1X_2...X_k),P(X_aX_bX_c...)$

### Env (to be continued)
